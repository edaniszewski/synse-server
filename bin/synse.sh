  Synse provides an API for monitoring and control of data center
  and IT equipment, including reading sensors and server power
  control - via. IPMI, PLC, RS485, I2C, SNMP, and Redfish.

  By default, the Synse service will run. Additional subcommands
  can be specified to start up various emulators alongside Synse.
  IPMI, SNMP, and Redfish emulators all run external to the
  Synse container, but PLC, RS485, and I2C can be started parallel
  to Synse.

  USAGE:  docker run vaporio/synse-server [flag | subcommand]

  Flags:
    --help | -h     Show this message.
    --version | -v  Show the version of Synse.
    --override | -o Specifies a file to use as the config override
                    file. This should be used in the format:
                    '--override=/path/to/file.json' with no space
                    separating the equals. This configuration will
                    only apply to any sub-commands specified AFTER
                    it positionally. In the example:
                      emulate-plc --o=cfg.json emulate-i2c
                    the cfg.json file would be set as the override
                    file AFTER the emulate-plc command processed, but
                    before the emulate-i2c command processed.

  Subcommands:
    start-plc-emulator [file]
            Start the PLC emulator without any Synse configurations
            put into place. With this, it is up to the user to make
            sure Synse has a PLC device (or devices) correctly
            configured (in the default/override config for devices).

            This can take a filename as a parameter to specify an
            emulator configuration.

    start-i2c-emulator [file]
            Start the I2C emulator without any Synse configurations
            put into place. With this, it is up to the user to make
            sure Synse has an I2C device (or devices) correctly
            configured (in the default/override config for devices).

            This can take a filename as a parameter to specify an
            emulator configuration.

    start-rs485-emulator [file]
            Start the RS485 emulator without any Synse configurations
            put into place. With this, it is up to the user to make
            sure Synse has an RS485 device (or devices) correctly
            configured (in the default/override config for devices).

            This can take a filename as a parameter to specify an
            emulator configuration.

    emulate-plc
            Start the PLC emulator. A default configuration file
            will be used.

    emulate-i2c
            Start the I2C emulator. A default configuration file
            will be used.

    emulate-rs485
            Start the RS485 emulator. A default configuration file
            will be used.

    emulate-plc-with-cfg [file]
            Start the PLC emulator, using the specified file as the
            emulator's backing data file.

    emulate-i2c-with-cfg [file]
            Start the I2C emulator, using the specified file as the
            emulator's backing data file.

    emulate-rs485-with-cfg [file]
            Start the RS485 emulator, using the specified file as the
            emulator's backing data file.
